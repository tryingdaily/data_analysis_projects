Certainly! Here's an example of an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram for the Online Marketplace Database:

```
        +------------+          +------------+
        |   User     |          |   Product  |
        +------------+          +------------+
        | user_id    |◇--------◇| product_id |
        | username   |          | name       |
        | email      |          | description|
        | reg_date   |          | price      |
        +------------+          | seller_id  |◇--------◇
                               | listing_date|
                               +------------+

         +-------------------+          +--------------+
         |    Transaction    |          |    Review    |
         +-------------------+          +--------------+
         | transaction_id    |◇--------◇| review_id    |
         | product_id        |◇--------◇| product_id   |◇--------◇
         | buyer_id          |◇--------◇| reviewer_id  |◇--------◇
         | seller_id         |◇--------◇| review_date  |
         | transaction_date  |          | review_text  |
         | transaction_status|          +--------------+
         +-------------------+
```

In this diagram:

- The "User" entity represents information about users, including their unique ID (user_id), username, email, and registration date.
- The "Product" entity represents information about products, including their unique ID (product_id), name, description, price, seller ID (seller_id), and listing date.
- The "Transaction" entity represents transaction records, including the transaction ID (transaction_id), the corresponding product ID (product_id), buyer ID (buyer_id), seller ID (seller_id), transaction date (transaction_date), and transaction status.
- The "Review" entity represents product reviews, including the review ID (review_id), the corresponding product ID (product_id), reviewer ID (reviewer_id), review date (review_date), and review text.

The relationships between the entities are represented by the lines connecting them:

- Users can have multiple products listed for sale (seller_id in Product) and can make multiple transactions as a buyer (buyer_id in Transaction).
- Products are associated with a single seller (seller_id in Product) and can be part of multiple transactions (product_id in Transaction).
- Transactions have a single buyer (buyer_id in Transaction) and a single seller (seller_id in Transaction) and are associated with a specific product (product_id in Transaction).
- Reviews are tied to a specific product (product_id in Review) and a specific reviewer (reviewer_id in Review).

Please note that this is a simplified representation of the database schema and relationships. You can customize and expand upon it based on your specific project requirements and additional entities or attributes you may need.
